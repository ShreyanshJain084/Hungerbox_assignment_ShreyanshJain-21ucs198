IT WAS PART OF MY BTECH MAJOR PROJECT</br>
</br>
I,along with my other teammates built this project.
Our solution, built using the MERN stack and Tailwind CSS, aims to solve two major real-life problems:
Allow online and advanced booking of parking spaces: This ensures that when you are going to any place, you do not worry about parking your vehicle.
Increase the visibility of parking lots: This results in profit maximization for parking lot owners.
Customers need to provide their location access to us, and we will show the nearby available parking lots sorted by nearest distance. To book a parking space online, users must first log in to our website, choose the desired parking lot, and book their parking.

<h1>Assignment: Designing a Parking Lot System</h1>
<p>A command-line-based Parking Lot System designed to efficiently manage parking spaces across multiple floors, 
supporting different vehicle types such as Cars, Bikes, and Trucks. This system follows object-oriented design principles, 
ensures concurrency handling, and provides essential functionalities like parking, unparking, and querying available spots.</p>
</br>
<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
</br>
<p>In this assignment,you will have to:</br>
</br>
Design and implement a parking lot system that supports the following requirements:</br>
<hr>
<h4>Functional Requirements:</h4>
</br>
1) The parking lot should have multiple floors, each with a fixed number of parking spots.</br>
2) vehicles can be of different types: Car, Bike, Truck.</br>
3) Different vehicle types require different space allocations:
   -Bike → 1 spot
   -Car → 1 spot
   -Truck → 2 consecutive spots</br>
4) A vehicle can enter the parking lot and be assigned the nearest available spot.</br>
5) A vehicle can leave, freeing up its spot(s).</br>
6) The system should allow querying:
   -Number of available spots per floor.
   -Whether the parking lot is full.
   -The current location &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a vehicle (if parked).</br>
<h4>Non Functional Requirements:</h4>
1) The solution should be object-oriented and follow clean coding principles.</br>
2) The system should handle concurrent parking operations safely.</br>
3) Optimize for quick vehicle lookup.</br>
4) The approach should be extended to future requirements. Command terminal based input/output will be fine.</br>

<h2>How to Run the Program</h2>
<h2>1. Clone the Repository</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using:</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/parking-lot-system.git
<h2>2.Open the CLI(command line interface) and go to the folder where the parking-lot-system.py file exists</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd parking-lot-system</code>
<h2>3. Run the Program</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>python parking_lot_system.py</code>
</br>

<h1>Explanation of the Program</h1>
The code itself is self-explanatory and I have also added the comments what each function is doing
